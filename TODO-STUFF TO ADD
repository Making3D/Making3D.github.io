Create _includes. They're a lot like _layouts, only smaller snippets of markup and can be injected into your _layouts and pages.
Try creating an _include file that inserts Google Analytics tracking code into your <head> so you can get stats on the visitors to your website. Here's an example.
Want commenting for your blog? Create a DISQUS _include and call it in your post.html layout.
Don't want github.io in your URL? Set up a custom domain.
Add blogging pagination
Create a sitemap.xml file for better SEO. You can have one automatically generated by GitHub Pages. See this one I use for my site.
Become a coding pro and create a development branch of your site. Each time you want to fix a bug or add a new feature you can create a copy of your master branch, make your changes, and then merge that branch to the master branch. The idea is to keep the master branch clean.
